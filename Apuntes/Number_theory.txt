Never compare real numbers with ==
fabs(a - b) < e  where e ~ 10^-10/15 depending on our needs
REMEMBER: (a + b) + c != a + (b + c)

Learn transformations:
  Avoid overflows.
  
  example:
	  we have logA and logB
	  we want log(A + B)
	  
	  log(A + B) = log(e^log A + e^log B) //this could overflow
	  
	  log(A + B) = log A + log(1 + e^(logB - logA)) //if A > B
				 = log B + log(1 + e^(logA - logB)) //if B > A
